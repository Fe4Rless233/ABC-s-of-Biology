# The ABC's of Biology
An interactive and educational website designed to teach fundamental biology concepts through an A-to-Z format. This project was created by Aklavya Kumar and Mehul Khattar.

🌟 Overview
"The ABC's of Biology" serves as a dynamic, single-page web application that presents a key biological term for each letter of the alphabet. Each entry is designed to be informative and visually engaging, making it an excellent study aid or introductory tool for students. The project leverages modern web technologies to create a smooth, animated, and user-friendly experience.

✨ Key Features
26 Unique Entries: Covers a wide range of topics, from "Analogous Structures" to "Zygote".

Detailed Content: Each entry includes:

A clear, student-written Definition.

A Photo to visually represent the concept.

A detailed Explanation of how the photo illustrates the term.

The corresponding academic Unit/Topic.

Interactive & Animated UI:

A sleek loading animation on entry.

Smooth, on-scroll animations that reveal content as the user navigates the page.

A clean, modern, and responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.

Self-Contained: The project runs entirely in the browser with no required installations or backend dependencies.
